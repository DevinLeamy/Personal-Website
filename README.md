# Personal-Website
My (Unfinished) Personal Website made using HTML, CSS, Javascript and a dash of JQuery and PHP. After having created The_Ultimate_Pathfinding_Website I thought I'd try my hand at making a personal website. As of now, the layout of the website is pretty much done. What I still have left TODO is change some of photos and text and, make the website responsive. I may end up revamping the website with Bootstrap because I've found that making a responsive website without Bootstrap is rather challenging. Here is the current state of the website https://devinleamy.github.io/Personal-Website/. NOTE: All of the Javascript, JQuery and PHP code is embedded as scripts in index.html.
