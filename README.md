# Personal-Website
My (Unfinished) Personal Website. Made using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap and JQuery. <br/>
I have finished designing the website's layout for large desktops. What I have left TODO is change the photo's, text and make the website responsive. As not I have have a vanilla HTML layout, however, in order to make the website responsive I may have to shift towards a Bootstrap grid layout. Here's the current state of the website: https://devinleamy.github.io/Personal-Website/ 
Note: The Javascript and JQuery code are in scripts embedded in index.html
